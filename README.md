BetterTradeApp(Barter)
=======================
This is the embryo of the Barter.<br>
The iterative model is used of the process design.<br>


##INSTRUCTION##

This App is used to deal with secondhand trading.<br>
The  major function of the app is to show the things which users
want to sell ,buy or exchange .<br>
It  can save the users' info and provide better services based on it,too.<br>
And I will enrich the function of the app in the future.<br>
